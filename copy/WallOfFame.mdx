    The Tightens - SCBWI Critique Group
    In 2007 when my writing course at Cal State Fullerton came concluded, Sonja Wilbert and I (along with four other writers) decided to continue critiquing our manuscripts on our own.  Sonja suggested we name our group the Tightens; with the school's moniker being the Titans, along with the fact we're trying to tighten each other's manuscripts, well...the name suck.  And, being a Fullerton alum, who was I to disagree?  So...here we are so many years later cranking out pages and critiquing each other's work.  This picture was taken in 2013.  To date, five of the six featured in the photo are still active members of the Tightens.  From left to right: Sonja Wilbert, me, Alan Williams, Beverly Plass (SCBWI SoCal Regional Advisor), Judy Lopez Honor Kathryn Firzmaurice (WHEN THE SWALLOWS COME EARLY, A DIAMOND IN THE DESERT, and DESTINY, REWRITTEN) and Pura Belpré Winning Author Ernesto Cisneros (ÉFREN DIVIDED and FALLING SHORT)
