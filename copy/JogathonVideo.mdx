# Light Sabers vs. Heavy Swords

In 2016, I was in charge of the annual Jogathon at my school.  Since a certain Force had awakened the previous year, the theme for our fundraising event was a no-brainer.  Conrad Holzman, an eighth-grade student at the time, brainstormed an idea for a promotional video with me.  Inspired, he then got to work.  Not only did he write the script, he also did the filming, editing, and incredible special effects.  Hollywood, watch out!  If he could put this video together as a 13-year-old, imagine what he can do now.
