# About Jesper Widén

Born, raised, and educated in Orange County, California, Jesper credits a roots-searching sojourn to Norrland, Sweden, for the inspiration of writing his debut novel.  It was south of the Arctic Circle in the village of Älvsbyn where he experienced sunless days throughout the winter solstice and mystic nights filled with the Northern Lights.  A first-generation American, Jesper is fluent in Swedish and uses his knowledge of the language and culture to bring authenticity to his Nordic world.
