Parts of the site can be edited simply by editing an MDX file, which is a lot easier than editing the website's code directly.

## How to edit markdown
Unless you want specific formatting changes, you should just be able to find the text that's currently on the site and replace it with the changes. For larger and more in-depth edits, refer to the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).
