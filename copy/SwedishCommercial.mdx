# Swedish Commercial

In 2007, my twin toddlers and I attended Swedish School in Orange County.  A fellow Pappa there told me about an advertisement he saw posted at Sjømannskirken in San Pedro.  Apoteket, a Swedish company, was searching for any Scandihoovians in the area who might want to audition for a commercial.  Apparently, they needed a summertime scene, and since it was winter in Sweden at the time, they figured they could film it in LA and pass it off as Sweden.  Anyway, I thought: "What the 'Hej'!" and went for it...and wouldn't you know it?!  I GOT THE PART!  It's a commercial promoting sunscreen.  When my cousin Petter saw it aired in Sweden, he immediately emailed me and wrote: "I saw a man on TV with a beard the size of Texas!"  The caption at the end of the video says: Lever man i mörker halva året är det svårt att hålla sig i skuggan.  Translation: When you live in darkness half the year, it's hard to keep yourself in the shade.
